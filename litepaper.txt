Neural Nexus ($NAE) Litepaper v2.0
==================================

1. Executive Summary
Neural Nexus is a decentralized intelligence and hyper-deflationary ecosystem built on Base Network. By combining advanced AI integration with a rigorous 25% ecosystem burn mechanism, Neural Nexus creates a scarcity-driven value proposition for long-term holders and participants.

2. Problem Statement
Current DeFi ecosystems often suffer from high inflation, lack of utility, and fragmented development. Neural Nexus addresses these by implementing a permanent deflationary model and a unified development framework (NX Monorepo) that ensures rapid, high-quality ecosystem growth.

3. The Solution: Neural Nexus ($NAE)
- Base Network: Leveraging Ethereum L2 for low-cost, high-speed transactions.
- Hyper-Deflation: A 25% tax on ecosystem-related transfers is permanently removed from supply.
- Fixed Supply: 1,000,000,000 $NAE tokens. No mint function.

4. Tokenomics
- Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 $NAE
- Network: Base (Optimism Stack)
- Tax Mechanism: 25% tax on transfers within ecosystem applications (Presale, Marketplaces, etc.)
- Burn Address: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD

5. Ecosystem Roadmap
Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- NX Monorepo setup.
- Smart contract auditing and testing.
- Community foundation.

Phase 2: Deployment
- Base Sepolia Testnet launch.
- Website migration to React/Next.js.
- Public Presale launch.

Phase 3: Expansion
- Mainnet deployment.
- Tier 1 DEX listings.
- AI Integration features launch.

6. Conclusion
Neural Nexus is more than a token; it is a self-sustaining ecosystem designed for maximum scarcity and utility. Join the nexus.
