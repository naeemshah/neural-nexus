📊 TOKENOMICS EXPLAINER

How does the 25% burn work?

1. User transfers 100 $NAE
2. 25 $NAE (25%) is burned permanently
3. 75 $NAE reaches recipient
4. Total supply decreases
5. Scarcity increases

Every transaction = deflation.

### Technical Achievement Post
```
**Technical Milestone: Smart Contract Security Audit Complete**

I'm pleased to share that our Neural Nexus smart contract has successfully completed its initial security audit!

**Key Findings:**
✅ **25% Burn Mechanism:** Properly implemented with owner exemption
✅ **Transfer Functions:** Optimized for gas efficiency
✅ **Event Logging:** Comprehensive for transparency
✅ **Security Features:** Protected against common vulnerabilities

**Technical Details:**
- **Contract:** NAE_Token.sol
- **Network:** Base (Ethereum L2 compatible)
- **Standards:** ERC-20 compliant with custom extensions
- **Testing:** 100% test coverage with Hardhat and Foundry

**Why This Matters:**
Security is paramount in DeFi. This audit ensures our token's foundational smart contract is robust, secure, and ready for mainnet deployment.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement audit recommendations
2. Begin mainnet deployment preparation
3. Expand test coverage for additional features

**Transparency:**
Full audit report available on our GitHub: [Link]

Building secure, intelligent DeFi infrastructure requires rigorous technical standards. We're committed to maintaining the highest level of security and transparency.

Special thanks to our development team and security reviewers for their diligent work!
