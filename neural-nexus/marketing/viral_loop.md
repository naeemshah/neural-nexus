# Neural Nexus: Stealth Launch Viral Loop Mapping

## Phase 2: The Viral Engine

The goal of Phase 2 is to transform initial buyers into active recruiters through a self-sustaining loop of scarcity and social signaling.

### 1. The Scarcity Trigger
*   **The Nexus Key:** Only wallets holding >100,000 $NAE are eligible to join the "Inner Nexus" (Private TG/Discord).
*   **Visual Signaling:** Exclusive badges/NFTs for high-volume burners. When a user burns $NAE, they get a sharable "Burn Proof" graphic.

### 2. The Social Loop
1.  **Burn to Earn Social Credit:** User burns $NAE -> System generates a "I just removed [X] $NAE from circulation forever. Scarcity is the only truth." graphic.
2.  **Influencer Amplification:** Seed graphics to mid-tier influencers. They post their "Burn Proof" to show they are "Aligned with the Nexus."
3.  **Community Raids:** Coordinated "Burn Raids" where the community burns a set amount simultaneously, trending the #ScarcityEngine hashtag.

### 3. Incentives
*   **Airdrop Tiers:** Future utility drops are weighted by the amount of $NAE a user has *burned*, not just held. This creates a "Protocol Loyalty" metric.
*   **The Void Board:** A leaderboard of top burners on the official website.

### 4. Viral KPIs
*   **Secondary Reach:** Number of #ScarcityEngine mentions per day.
*   **Burn Velocity:** Total $NAE burned per week (excluding Genesis).
*   **Member Growth:** Conversion rate from Twitter impressions to TG members.
