## 2. The Visionary Narrative (Founder's Vision)
**Heading:** A New Paradigm of Value.
**Copy:** 
Founder Naeem Shah envisioned Neural Nexus not just as a token, but as a self-sustaining engine. In a world of digital abundance, value is found in precision and scarcity. Neural Nexus bridges the gap between complex blockchain mechanics and intuitive, high-impact user experiences.

## 4. How It Works (The Hyper-Deflationary Core)
**Heading:** The $NAE Burn Engine
**Sub-heading:** Programmatic Scarcity in Action.

**Step 1: The Genesis Burn**
We started with fire. 25% of the total $NAE supply (250M tokens) was sent to a dead address at launch, creating an immediate and permanent reduction in circulating supply.

**Step 2: Ecosystem Transaction Tax**
The Nexus doesn't just sit still. A 25% fee is applied to all transfers involving designated ecosystem addresses (dApps, specialized wallets, and launchpads).

**Step 3: Permanent Removal**
100% of every transaction fee is immediately and automatically burned. No redistribution, no hidden wallets—just pure, programmatic removal of supply.

**Step 4: Finite Supply**
No new $NAE can ever be minted. The supply only goes one way: Down.

*   **Real-Time Burn Tracking:** Watch the supply shrink in real-time as the ecosystem evolves.
