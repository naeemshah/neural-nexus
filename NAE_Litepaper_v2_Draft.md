# Neural Nexus ($NAE) Litepaper v2.0 (DRAFT)

## 1. The Core Thesis: Hyper-Deflationary AI Utility
Neural Nexus is not just another token; it is an economic experiment in **Digital Attrition**. By combining the Base network's efficiency with a relentless burn mechanism, $NAE (Nexus AI Engine) creates a shrinking supply floor designed to maximize long-term holder value.

## 2. Updated Tokenomics: The 25% Burn Engine
In v2, we clarify the "Frictionless Scarcity" model:
- **Direct Burn Tax:** Every interaction with our ecosystem smart contracts (Launchpad, AI modules, swaps) triggers a **25% fee**.
- **The Black Hole:** 100% of collected fees are sent to the `0x00...dead` address.
- **Scarcity Velocity:** As the ecosystem grows in utility, the burn rate accelerates, creating an inverse relationship between usage and supply.

## 3. Brand Evolution: From Cyber Emerald to Digital Obsidian
While Cyber Emerald (#00FF9F) remains our signature highlight, v2 shifts the focus toward **Digital Obsidian**. We are moving away from "bright sci-fi" toward a more "sovereign tech" aesthetic—darker, sharper, and more premium.

## 4. The "Nexus Engine" AI Utility
$NAE holders will gain tiered access to our proprietary AI tools:
- **Nexus Scraper:** Real-time sentiment analysis for Base tokens.
- **Burn Watcher:** Automated tracking of $NAE deflationary milestones.
- **Neural Forge:** AI-assisted contract deployment for ecosystem partners.

## 5. Security & Transparency
- **Renounced Ownership:** The $NAE contract is immutable.
- **Audit-First Culture:** Every module added to the Nexus ecosystem must pass a community-vetted audit.
