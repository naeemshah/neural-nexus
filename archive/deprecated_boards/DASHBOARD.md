# Neural Nexus Team Dashboard
Last Updated: 2026-02-11 03:40 UTC

## Team Status
- **PM**: Coordinating Jira migration and blocker resolution. NX workspace initialized.
- **Backend Dev**: Working on Monorepo structure. [BLOCKER: Missing local dependencies (OpenZeppelin, Foundry)]
- **Frontend Dev**: Planning React rewrite. [WAITING: NX Monorepo Finalization]
- **QA**: Planning test cases for NAE_Token burn tax logic.
- **Marketing**: Refining Litepaper v2 charts for ecosystem burn visualization.

## Blockers
1. **Toolchain dependencies**: Backend dev needs `forge` (Foundry) and OpenZeppelin contracts installed in the workspace.
2. **Monorepo Dependency**: Frontend migration is waiting for the NX directory structure to be fully finalized by Backend.
