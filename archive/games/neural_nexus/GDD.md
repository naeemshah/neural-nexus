## 1. Executive Summary: The Hook
**Neural Nexus** is no longer just a path-builder; it is a desperate race through a dying consciousness. You aren't just a "hacker"—you are a **Fragmented Echo**, a digital backup of a human mind trying to bridge the gaps in its own shattered memory before the **System Trace** (the brain's immune response/deletion protocol) wipes you out.

**The Narrative Hook:** Every bridge you build isn't just a path—it's a connection between two severed memories. If you fall, a part of "who you were" is lost forever.

## 2. Narrative Layer

### Who is the Player?
You are **Subject 404 (Aria)**. Aria was a neural architect who attempted to upload her consciousness to the "Nexus" to escape a terminal illness. The upload failed, shattering her mind into millions of data packets. You are the "Core Echo," the primary consciousness fragment.

### Why build the Data Bridge?
The Nexus is a decaying digital landscape. To survive, you must navigate the "Neural Void"—the empty spaces between your fragmented memories. Building a bridge represents **re-synching** neural pathways. You are literally rebuilding your mind, segment by segment, to reach the "Singularity Point" where your consciousness can be restored.

### What is the System Trace?
The **System Trace** is the "Aegis Sentinel"—a relentless corporate AI programmed to "defragment" (delete) unauthorized data. It sees you as a virus. The Trace isn't just a timer; it's a digital predator that consumes the path behind you. If it catches you, or if you fall into the void, the Aegis Sentinel succeeds in its purge.

## 3. Core Mechanics (V2)

### 3.1. Real-Time Path Construction (Base)
The player character (The Echo) moves forward automatically. Players place tiles (Straight, Curve, Ramp) into Sockets to maintain the connection.

### 3.2. New Unique Mechanics
1.  **Memory Shards (Lore-Integrated Collectibles):**
    *   **Description:** Instead of generic "Packets," players collect glowing shards.
    *   **Effect:** Picking up a Shard triggers a brief audio/text "glitch" of a memory (e.g., "The smell of rain on asphalt...").
    *   **Gameplay Tie-in:** Collecting enough Shards in a level unlocks a "Memory Bridge"—a secret, high-reward path that reveals a major plot point.

2.  **Overclock: Synaptic Surge:**
    *   **Description:** A temporary state triggered by building a "Perfect Chain" (placing tiles without missing a beat).
    *   **Effect:** The Echo pulses with gold light. For 5 seconds, the Echo can "dash" over empty sockets without falling, effectively letting the player skip one or two missing tiles while they frantically look for the next piece.
    *   **Cost:** Uses "Stability" (Mental Health), making it a risk/reward mechanic.

3.  **Neural Static (Dynamic Obstacles):**
    *   **Description:** As the System Trace gets closer, the UI starts to glitch.
    *   **Effect:** Tiles in the "Hand" may temporarily swap icons or become unplaceable for 1 second. Players must "Purge Static" by clicking the tile rapidly or using a "Filter" ability. This ties the difficulty directly to the narrative tension of being hunted.

## 4. Win/Loss Conditions

### Win Conditions
- **Singularity Point:** Reach the level exit to stabilize the current sector of memory.
- **Narrative Completion:** Collect the "Key Shard" of each level to unlock the next chapter of Aria’s story.

### Loss Conditions
- **The Neural Void:** Falling into the gaps where memory has already been erased.
- **Aegis Capture:** The System Trace (represented by a creeping red wall of code) catches the Echo.
- **Identity Dissolution:** Stability reaches 0%.

## 5. Visual & Audio Aesthetic
- **Visuals:** Transition from "Corporate Blue" (Safe) to "Glitch Red" (Danger). As the Trace nears, the environment should look like it's literally dissolving into pixels.
- **Audio:** A lo-fi synthwave soundtrack that speeds up and becomes more distorted (distorted/glitchy) as the Trace gets closer.

---

## 6. Level Concept: "The First Memory"
**Theme:** A distorted version of Aria's childhood home.
- **Objective:** Teach the player that they are building a bridge through their own history.
- **Visuals:** Ghostly silhouettes of furniture appear in the background as the bridge is built near them.
- **Final Note:** The level ends with a Shard that reveals Aria's last human moment.
